# Print Something (Part 1)
# Write a program that asks the user whether they want the program to print
# "something", then print it if the user enters `y`. Otherwise, print nothing.
#
# Examples:
# $ ruby something.rb
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# y
# something
# 
# $ ruby something.rb
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# n
# 
# $ ruby something.rb
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# help

puts ">> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)"
response = gets.chomp
puts 'something' if response == 'y'

# Further Exploration
# What happens if you type 'Y' (in uppercase) instead of `y` in response to
# the prompt? This is a bad user experience: when obtaining input from a user,
# you should almost always allow both uppercase and lowercase entries. Can you
# modify this program so that it prints "something" if the user enters `Y` or
# `y`?

puts ">> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)"
response = gets.chomp
puts 'something' if response.downcase == 'y'
