# Passwords
# Write a program that displays a welcome message, but only after the user
# enters the correct password, where the password is a string that is defined
# as a constant in your program. Keep asking for the password until the user
# enters the correct password.
#
# Examples:
#
# $ ruby password.rb
# >> Please enter your password:
# Hello
# >> Invalid password!
# >> Please enter your password:
# Secret
# >> Invalid password!
# >> Please enter your password:
# SecreT
# Welcome!

PASSWORD = 'SecreT'
loop do
  puts '>> Please enter your password:'
  password_try = gets.chomp
  break if password_try == PASSWORD
  puts '>> Invalid password!'
end
puts 'Welcome!'
